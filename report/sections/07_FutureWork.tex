\section{Future work}
The following experiments would be interesting to consider for future work.


\subsection{Device RSSI value differences}

During this project we did not look into whether switching phone device would have an impact on the measured RSSI values.


\subsection{Multiple devices, user moving towards system, other}

The possibility of two users moving towards the same system is appearent. Therefor, to test how the RSSI value varies when multiple devices are near the system would be interesting.


\subsection{Time of Arrival (ToA)}
ToA is a method for measuring the distance between two objects, by measuring the time it takes a radio signal to travel between the objects. This is the same technique used in gps. ToA can provide reliable distance measurements but requires special hardware. This might serve as an interesting alternative to using the RSSI value of a Bluetooth device.
