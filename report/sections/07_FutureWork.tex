\section{Future work}
The following experiments would be interesting to consider for future work.


\subsection{Difference in RSSI from different devices}
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if and how much devices differs in RSSI value measured from the same distance. The distance from the user to the system is solely determined using the RSSI value and therefor it is interesting to see how the each device influences the distance.
	
The following devices has been chosen for this experiment: An iPhone 5, a Rasberry Pi and a Nexus 5 ... 



\subsection{Multiple devices, user moving towards system, other}
The possibility of two users moving towards the same system is appearent. We therefor test how the RSSI value varies when multiple devices are near the system.

This experiment ...


\subsubsection{Time of Arrival (ToA)}
ToA is a method for measuring the distance between two objects, by measuring the time it takes a radio signal to travel between the objects. This is the same technique used in gps. ToA can provide reliable distance measurements but requires special hardware

However this approach will not run reliably without special hardware for measuring time accurately, and is therefore out of scope when using normal BLE devices like phones.
