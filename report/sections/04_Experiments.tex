\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Test setup}

On Raspberry pi and Ubuntu we used the official bluetooth stack BlueZ.
The devices needs to be configured to use Bluetooth LE, this is done by running the command ‘sudo hciconfig hci0 leadv’

\subsection{Scenarios}

The base scenario consists of a Raspberry Pi with custom software as the system.
This system is the static part of the test scenarios and from it distance to nearby devices are measured.
The devices in the test scenarios will be a collection of cell phones from different vendors and other wearables.
The devices will be both static and moving depending on the test scenario.


\subsubsection{Difference in RSSI from different devices}
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if and how much devices differs in RSSI value measured from the same distance. The distance from the user to the system is solely determined using the RSSI value and therefor it is interesting to see how the each device influences the distance.
	
The following devices has been chosen for this experiment: An iPhone 5, a Rasberry Pi and a Nexus 5 ... 

\subsubsection{Single user moving towards system}
\label{section:MovingTowardsSystem}
In order for our authentication method to work a threshold, that determines if the user is close enough for authentication, must be set. The purpose of this experiment is to define this threshold by measuring the RSSI value of a single device at different differences, allowing us to define how close the user needs to be in order to be authenticated. 

The system location is constant during this experiment. The device used is an iPhone 5 ...

\subsubsection{Single user moving away from system}
The distance threshold for logging out might differ from the threshold for logging in. Maybe the user needs to be away from the system for some amount of time before the user is logged out. 

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the threshold for logging out. The data from experiment \ref{section:MovingTowardsSystem} is used ...


\subsubsection{Multiple devices, user moving towards system, other}
The possibility of two users moving towards the same system is appearent. We therefor test how the RSSI value varies when multiple devices are near the system.

This experiment ...
