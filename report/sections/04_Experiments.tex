\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Test setup}

On Raspberry pi and Ubuntu we used the official bluetooth stack BlueZ.
The devices needs to be configured to use Bluetooth LE, this is done by running the command ‘sudo hciconfig hci0 leadv’

\subsection{Scenarios}

The base scenario consists of a Raspberry Pi with custom software as the system.
This system is the static part of the test scenarios and from it distance to nearby devices are measured.
The devices in the test scenarios will be a collection of cell phones from different vendors and other wearables.
The devices will be both static and moving depending on the test scenario.


\subsubsection{Difference in RSSI from different devices}
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if and how much devices differs in RSSI value measured from the same distance. The distance from the user to the system is solely determined using the RSSI value and therefor it is interesting to see how the each device influences the distance.
	The following devices has been chosen for this experiment: An iPhone 5, a Rasberry Pi and a Nexus 5... 

\subsubsection{Single user moving towards system}
Plot RSSI pr. meter

Discover RSSI threshold for login

\subsubsection{Single user moving away from system}
Discover RSSI threshold for logout

\subsubsection{Multiple devices, user moving towards system, other}
Interferens?

\subsubsection{Multiple devices, two users moving towards the system}
Who will be authenticated first?
