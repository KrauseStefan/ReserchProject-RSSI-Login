This paper proposes a nearby-system authentication method using Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device. The purpose of the method is to give the user a seamless authentication experience and save the user time when logging in. The characteristics of an iPhone 5's RSSI value at different distances and in different environments were analyzed in preliminary experiments. According to the results of these experiments, the proposed method combines processing using RSSI value threshold with a median filter to reduce noise. The optimal value for a RSSI threshold was ...
