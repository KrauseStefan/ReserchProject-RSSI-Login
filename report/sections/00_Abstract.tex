This paper proposes a nearby-system authentication method using Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device. 
The purpose of the method is to give the user a seamless authentication experience and save the user time when logging in. 
The characteristics of an iPhone 5's RSSI value at different distances and in different environments were analyzed in preliminary experiments. 
Because of the noisy results from the preliminary experiments we propose to use a combination of a median filter and a hysteresis threshold to achieve stable values as a means for authentication.
A proof of concept application was developed proving that it is possible to seamlessly authenticate a user based on RSSI if the application is calibrated to the surrounding environment.
