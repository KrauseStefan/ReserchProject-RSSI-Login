\section{Conclusion}
Using RSSI value as viable means for proximity detection is possible but slightly inaccurate. Therefor we implemented a solution which uses a filter and a hysteresis threshhold combined, to remove noise from RSSI measureents and optimize accuracy, to make a more consistent proximity detection.

%A partial authentication model has been proposed taking the security aspect of calm authentication into consideration. The model has three levels of trust: Low, Medium and High allowing different read/write/edit rights according to the level of trust.

We have shown that context aware authentication using Bluetooth Low Energy is possible using RSSI measurements for proximity detection.
