\section{Conclusion}
Using RSSI value as viable means for proximity detection is possible but inaccurate. Therefore we implemented a solution which uses a filter and a hysteresis threshhold combined, to remove noise from RSSI measurements and optimize accuracy and thereby make a more consistent proximity detection.

RSSI values depends on multiple factors, such as distance, reflections from environment, transmission strength, etc., which is reflected in our test results. Environment knowledge prior to implementing authentication using RSSI values is therefore crucial.

%A partial authentication model has been proposed taking the security aspect of calm authentication into consideration. The model has three levels of trust: Low, Medium and High allowing different read/write/edit rights according to the level of trust.

%We have shown that context aware authentication using Bluetooth Low Energy is possible using RSSI measurements for proximity detection.
