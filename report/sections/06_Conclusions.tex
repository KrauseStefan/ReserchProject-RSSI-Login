\section{Conclusion}
Using RSSI value as a viable means for proximity detection is quite hard. We have shown that it is possible to use RSSI for proximity detection when proximity is defined by a treshold. We have proposed filters to remove noise from the RSSI measurements in order to ensure a more consistent proximity detection.

A partial authentication model has been proposed taking the security aspect of calm authentication into consideration. The model has three levels of trust: Low, Medium and High allowing different read/write/edit rights according to the level of trust.

We have shown that context aware authentication using Bluetooth Low Energy is possible using RSSI measurements for proximity detection combined with a partial authentication model to maintain the security of the system.
